    * This project is mostly for practice so contributions aren't expected, but any and all are welcome so long as they are properly documented

## Tests

  * Jest is used to test all functionality of this application

## Known Bugs

  * Currently everything is working as intended!

## Future Development

  * Currently the styling of the generated HTML document is a little bland for my taste so I plan on testing a few different looks. This application could also benefit from additional information for each employee and a directory for current and upcoming team tasks
